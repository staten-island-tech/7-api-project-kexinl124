This article assumes you are on windows 10 and using Python 3.10 from the Microsoft Store

Begin in the terminal typing the following.
```
python3 -m venv app  
```
This should have created a folder called "app" with a virtual environment. VSCode will ask you if you want to activate the environment. If you are unable to activate the environment then type the following depneding on your terminal environment.

If Powershell, first change directory in the terminal to use the app folder (or whatver your project is called)
```
cd app
```
then activate
```
Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
If command prompt (CMD), first change directory in the terminal to use the app folder (or whatver your project is called)
```
cd app
```
then activate
```
Scripts/activate.bat
```
Be sure to copy and create a .gitignore file for your directory to not commit unnecessary files

We can also look at the bottom right of VSCode and change the interpreter path.

# Installing Requests 

```
pip install requests
```

Pip allows us to install outside packages for our apps. 
Ensure that after installing and importing in your .py file that there are no underlines indicating the package is not found. If it is not found you are not active in the virtual env. 

# Running the file
You will now likely need to use 
``` cmd 
python app.py
```

in order to run the file. Keep in mind the location of the file relative to your terminal

following might be needed.
```
cd ../
```
# 🧠 Lesson: Catching Pokémon with Python 

### SWBAT (Students Will Be Able To):

* Explain what the `requests` library does and why we use it
* Use list comprehensions to make new lists quickly
* Use `.items()` to loop through key-value pairs in a dictionary

## 🕹️ Step 1: What’s happening in our code?

```python
import requests

def getPoke(poke):
    response = requests.get(f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{poke.lower()}")
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Error fetching data!")
        return None
    
    data = response.json()
    return {
        "name": data["name"],
        "height": data["height"],
        "weight": data["weight"],
        "types": [t["type"]["name"] for t in data["types"]]
    }

pokemon = getPoke("Bulbasaur")
print(pokemon)
```

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Understanding `requests`

Imagine your Python program as a **trainer** 👩‍💻 sending a message to a **Pokémon Center** 🏥 (the internet).

When you do:

```python
requests.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur")
```

you’re saying:

> “Hey Pokémon Center! Please send me all the information you have on Bulbasaur!”

The center sends back a **big package** 📦 of data.
That package is called a **response**.

We open the box using:

```python
data = response.json()
```

Now we can see everything inside — names, types, height, weight, etc.
It’s like opening a Pokédex entry!

---

## 🧠 Step 3: What is a Dictionary?

A **dictionary** in Python is like a **backpack with labeled pockets** 🎒.

Example:

```python
pokemon = {
    "name": "Bulbasaur",
    "type": "grass",
    "weight": 69
}
```

Each pocket has:

* A **key** (the label) → `"name"`, `"type"`, `"weight"`
* A **value** (what’s inside) → `"Bulbasaur"`, `"grass"`, `69`

So when you ask:

```python
print(pokemon["type"])
```

Python looks for the pocket labeled `"type"` and gives you `"grass"` 🌿.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Looping with `.items()`

What if you want to look inside **every pocket** in your backpack?

You can use:

```python
for key, value in pokemon.items():
    print(key, "→", value)
```

Output:

```
name → Bulbasaur
type → grass
weight → 69
```

Analogy:

> `.items()` lets you say, “Show me *each pocket label* and *what’s inside it*.”

---

## ⚡ Step 5: What’s that weird `[t["type"]["name"] for t in data["types"]]` thing?

That’s called a **list comprehension** — a short way to make a new list.

The long way would be:

```python
types = []
for t in data["types"]:
    types.append(t["type"]["name"])
```

The short version:

```python
types = [t["type"]["name"] for t in data["types"]]
```

Analogy:

> Think of it like making a tray of cookies 🍪.
> You take each dough ball (`t`) and shape it into a cookie (`t["type"]["name"]`).
> When you’re done, you have a whole new tray (a new list).

---

## 🧠 Step 6: Putting it all together

After your function runs, you get something like:

```python
{
  'name': 'bulbasaur',
  'height': 7,
  'weight': 69,
  'types': ['grass', 'poison']
}
```

Now you can use `.items()` to print it nicely:

```python
pokemon = getPoke("Bulbasaur")

for key, value in pokemon.items():
    print(f"{key.title()}: {value}")
```

Output:

```
Name: bulbasaur
Height: 7
Weight: 69
Types: ['grass', 'poison']
```

| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `requests.get()`   | Gets info from a website       | Sending a letter to the Pokémon Center |
| `.json()`          | Opens the package              | Opening your data box                  |
| Dictionary         | Stores info as key:value       | Backpack with labeled pockets          |
| `.items()`         | Loops through both key + value | Checking every pocket                  |
| List comprehension | Builds new lists quickly       | Cookie cutter for data                 |
